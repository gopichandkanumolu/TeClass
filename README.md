# TeClass

This repository contains the code and dataset of the research paper titled <b>"TeClass: A Human-Annotated Relevance-based Headline Classification and Generation Dataset for Telugu"</b>, accepted at LREC-COLING 2024.

<span style="color:red"><b>Intro:</b></span> 
<b>Headline Generation</b> is the task of generating a relevant headline that represents the core information present in the news article. The key challenge is that, the performance of the headline generation model depends on the quality of the training data, and the presence of irrelevant headlines in news articles scraped from the web often results in sub-optimal performance.
As a solution to overcome these challenges, We propose that <b>Relevance-based Headline Classification</b> can greatly aid the task of generating relevant headlines.

Please note: Code & Dataset will be made available very soon.
