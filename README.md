This repository contains the code and dataset of the research paper titled <b>"TeClass: A Human-Annotated Relevance-based Headline Classification and Generation Dataset for Telugu"</b>, accepted at LREC-COLING 2024.

# Task Introduction
**Headline Generation** is the task of generating a relevant headline that represents the core information present in the news article. The key challenge is that, the performance of the headline generation model depends on the quality of the training data, and the presence of irrelevant headlines in news articles scraped from the web often results in sub-optimal performance.
As a solution to overcome these challenges, We propose that <b>Relevance-based Headline Classification</b> can greatly aid the task of generating relevant headlines.

**Relevance-based Headline Classification​** is the task of categorizing a news headline based on its relevance to the corresponding news article​ into one of the three primary classes:
  1. Highly Relevant (HREL)
  2. Moderately Relevant​ (MREL)
  3. Least Relevant (LREL)
    
It has applications including News Recommendation, Incongruent Headline Detection​​, and Headline Stance Classification​.
